Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
MissingOutputException in line 24 of /Users/ecevarol/Desktop/Research/lower_threshold_project/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
test.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
