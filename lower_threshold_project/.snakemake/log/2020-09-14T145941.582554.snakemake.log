Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	get_data
	1

rule get_data:
    input: simulation.slim
    output: env_var.txt
    jobid: 0

Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
