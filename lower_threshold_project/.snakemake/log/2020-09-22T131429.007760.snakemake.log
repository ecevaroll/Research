Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	get_data
	1

rule get_data:
    input: simulation.slim
    output: env_var

Error in rule get_data:
    jobid: 0
    output: env_var
    shell:
        slim  -d envVar=0.05 -d adjustment=0 -d L=1e4 -d thres=1 simulation.slim
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
